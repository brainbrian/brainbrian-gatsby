Zelda Tri Force Heroes is a game for the Nintendo 3DS. It has a unique multiplayer component we tried to bring to life throughout this single page, scrolling site. The user is taken through page content by scrolling vertically or interacting with the totem navigation when on desktop. The site comes to life with interactive animations all done with CSS and JavaScript. I was the lead interactive developer on this project at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com). We used Grunt as our front-end static build system along with SCSS and CommonJS modules.
