## Health Corner

#### December 15th, 2006

I worked on developing sites to support the [Health Corner TV Series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243727/) [Marx Creative](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marx-creative/about/) independently produced for [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com). I helped distribute media both online and through the production of DVDs. I assisted developing an in-store video network initiative between Marx and Walgreens.

## ChefMD Online

#### October 1st, 2007

[ChefMD.com](https://www.drjohnlapuma.com/chefmd/) is an online site supporting the ChefMD television segment appearing on Health Corner airing on Lifetime. I brainstormed, planned, and lead development on the site.

We built a custom CMS with PHP and MySQL to support recipes, shopping lists, videos, member registration, news, and email lists. The site also includes helpful tools like health calculators and searching for recipes by health conditions.
