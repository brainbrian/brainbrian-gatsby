## Health Corner

### 2006-12-15

I worked on developing sites to support television programming Marx Creative produced for Walgreens and independently. I helped distribute media both online and through the production of DVDs. I assisted developing an in-store video network initiative between Marx and Walgreens.

## ChefMD Online

### 2007-10-01

ChefMD.com is an online site supporting the ChefMD television segment appearing on Health Corner airing on Lifetime. I brainstormed, planned, and lead development on the site. We built a custom CMS with PHP and MySQL to support recipes, shopping lists, videos, member registration, news, and email lists. The site also includes helpful tools like health calculators and searching for recipes by health conditions.
