Target came to POP with an ask to turn their history page into a more interactive and engaging online experience. The history page used to be one long scrolling page of information. Target was very happy with outcome of the new interactive version where users can interact with individual points in Target's history and filter by different categories. I was the Flash developer and animator on this project. I also played an active roll in brainstorming and planning the experience.
