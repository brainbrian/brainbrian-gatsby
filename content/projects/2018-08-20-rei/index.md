I work on the [Classes/Events](https://www.rei.com/events) and [Adventures](https://www.rei.com/adventures) team at REI. In my role I am the lead frontend software engineer for the team. We work in a continuous integrated environment with Docker, Java, Jenkins and more. Currently I'm spending most of my time updating our frontend systems to be written in ES6 linting standards with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). I use build tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and dependency management on the frontend is done via our private NPM repository.
