## Pokémon Go Website

#### July 6th, 2016

For the launch of the Pokémon Go mobile application, another engineer and myself put together the [original marketing site](https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/) for the application while working at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com). This site was localized in over 10 languages.

## Pokémon Platinum: Rotom Viewer Desktop Application

#### October 1st, 2009

Pokémon tasked POP with creating a fun gift for Pokémon fans to unlock when they purchased a game and found the code inside the packaging. Fans could then go to [pokemonplatinum.com](https://www.pokemonplatinum.com/#/rotom/) with their code and download the [Adobe AIR](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/05/30/the-future-of-adobe-air.html) desktop application.

Users would use the Rotom Viewer to explore their desktop and reveal hidden Pokémon. I was the lead developer and animator on the project.
