During the 2013-2014 snowboard season the Mervin Mfg. web team was tasked with building an online do-it-yourself snowboard builder. We are fortunate at Lib Tech to build our snowboards in the USA at our own factory in Sequim, WA. This allows us to do experimental programs like the diy builder and scale them based on their success. The web application utilizes responsive web-design and Shopatronâ€™s Add-To-Cart API to allow users to design and order their own custom one-of-a-kind snowboard delivered right to their doorstep from any device. Users can build their own snowboard while heading up a lift for some pow turns!
