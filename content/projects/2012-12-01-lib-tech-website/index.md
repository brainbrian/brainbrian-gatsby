The Lib Tech brand and e-commerce website is an ever-evolving project I have lead development on since 2012. Over that time we’ve reworked the entire shopping experience to use Shopatron’s latest JavaScript APIs and have one experience, both brand and e-commerce within the same website. We’ve rolled out responsive templates, product finding and building applications, micro-site marketing experiences, as well as focusing on SEO and browser compatibility. I planned and built our build system using Grunt.js, SASS and our own JavaScript design patterns.
