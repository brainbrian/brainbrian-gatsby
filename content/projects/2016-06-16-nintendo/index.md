## Star Fox Zero

### 2016-06-16

https://starfoxzero.nintendo.com

Nintendo did a reboot of Star Fox for the Wii U. With the Star Fox Zero website we tried to convey the feel of Star Fox world online. Bringing in rich character art and dynamic animations we brought this reboot to life. Dynamic galaxy animations behind the menu overlay using HTML5 canvas, complex scrolling animations within the Lylat System and in depth character and vehicle interactions all bring this site to life. I was the lead interactive developer on this project at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com/).

## Zelda Tri Force Heroes

Zelda Tri Force Heroes is a game for the Nintendo 3DS. It has a unique multiplayer component we tried to bring to life throughout this single page, scrolling site. The user is taken through page content by scrolling vertically or interacting with the totem navigation when on desktop. The site comes to life with interactive animations all done with CSS and JavaScript. I was the lead interactive developer on this project at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com). We used Grunt as our front-end static build system along with SCSS and CommonJS modules.

While at POP, I was the lead interactive developer on the Mario Sports Mix site. The site promoted the upcoming game for the Nintendo Wii. We used 3D animation and a lot of motion to bring the site to life.

I've assisted in many Nintendo projects while working at POP, but Animal Crossing for the Wii was the first project I played a lead roll in. All of the Flash components were developed by myself.
