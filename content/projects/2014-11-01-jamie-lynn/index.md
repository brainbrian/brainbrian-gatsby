The 2014/2015 winter season was the 20 year anniversary celebration of professional snowboarder Jamie Lynn’s pro line with Lib Technologies. In honor of his 20 years of pro-models with Lib Tech we planned a marketing campaign around his career history and products. We built a responsive, scrolling website to showcase photos, products, notable quotes from industry pros and a featured 20 year video. The website uses complex scrolling techniques to preset a pleasing, focused look into Jamie’s career with Lib Technologies.
