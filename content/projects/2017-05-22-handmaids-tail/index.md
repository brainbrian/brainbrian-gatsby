Hulu's [The Handmaid's Tale](https://www.hulu.com/the-handmaids-tale) is now airing. I built a single page application on AWS using Lambda, S3, NodeJS, Webpack, React, Redux and Babel to support their social campaign. This application takes in a users code, grants them access to a secret group and allows them to invite up to 5 friends.
