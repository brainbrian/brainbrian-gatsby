The Starbucks team at Blast Radius was tasked with creating a campaign to reward a city with the most excitement around the fall launch of pumpkin spice latte. I was a lead in the conception and development of the Facebook application that allowed users to get PSL a week early in their city. The city earning the most points would win. Facebook users were given various tasks to complete in order to receive points.
