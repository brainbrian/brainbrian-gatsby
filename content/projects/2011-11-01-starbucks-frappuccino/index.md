I helped concept, plan and build all things digital surrounding the Frappuccino brand in 2011. On frappuccino.com users could build drinks and an accompanying poster to promote their drink. They were then entered into a contest and awarded prizes for the most liked drink. I also worked on various paid media campaigns and the mobile website. I'm currently working on the 2012 version of the Frappuccino digital brand.
