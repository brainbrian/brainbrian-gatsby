Throughout high school and college I played in a couple of bands. One of the bands was called (for the majority of the time) "The Autumn View". I started out playing guitar in the band in middle school when we were called "Westbound". We evolved over the years, as many adolescents do.

In 2003 we released our first full-length record on our friend's label, Uniform Records. This release is titled "Fist-Fighting with Broken Wrists". Below is the album artwork for the CDs that went into production. I did the graphic design on the album.

These are 2 of many t-shirt designs we came up with over the years. The one on the left was, I believe, the most popular design. The "TV Girl" on the right was one of my favorites.
