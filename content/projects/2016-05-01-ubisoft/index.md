## Customer Support Website

### 2016-05-01

Ubisoft came to POP for a overhaul on their current customer support website. This project was a little different than normal. I lead the development team at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com) in a co-development of the site with Ubisoftâ€™s backend team. We provided static site template files with static JSON endpoints that Ubisoft then integrated into their support backend system. This was a great partnership between POP and Ubisoft, and the result is one fantastic, responsive customer support website.
