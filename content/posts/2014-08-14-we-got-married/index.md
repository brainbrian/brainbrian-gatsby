I met my wife, Amanda, on October 31st, 2010. Now over 3 years later we tied the knot at [Red Cedar Farm](https://redcedarfarm.com) in Poulsbo, WA.

It was such a special day for us and we couldn't have been happier to share it with all of our family and friends. Thank you everyone who helped make this happen and to my wife, Amanda, for believing-in and trusting me.

Thank you Dan and Jeremy for the photography and filming. You can find and book Dan at [Dan Manning Photography](https://danmanningphotography.com). The film was shot primarily by Jeremy Dubs and edited by myself.
