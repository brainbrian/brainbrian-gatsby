I finally found something that works, and it's free. I've heard several people from some user groups I go to speak of [Linotype FontExplorerX](https://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX). I never even thought to bother and just continued to struggle with font book and system fonts. My applications would take forever to load, but I just went right along. I finally took the time to install the FREE Linotype FontExplorerX and I love it. If you own a mac and know how to use iTunes and plan on doing any design work with fonts (even just to tinker around in photoshop), I strongly suggest installing this program. I'm sure once again, this is nothing new to most, but I'm just starting. I never wanted to chalk up money for font suitcase.
