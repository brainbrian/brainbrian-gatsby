Adobe has me excited about a couple things this past week. First the announcement of HD Video in flash player! Adobe released flash player 9 update 3 and it now supports HD quality video: [Press Release](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/120407adobemoviestar.html).

The other thing that has me excited is my discovery in Adobe Labs of [BRIO](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/brio/). It's a nice tool I have found useful for freelance work with others is titled: . It's the next generation of acrobat connect and is free! After reading a bit, I think it will always be free for up to 3 people. Beyond that you'll need to look into acrobat connect. Pretty sweet for you freelance teams out there.
