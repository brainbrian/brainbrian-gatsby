I know this is no new news for most, but I just realized today Gmail now supports IMAP!  I stopped using the POP3 capabilities a while ago because I hated it not syncing, but now IMAP is supported.  YAY!  I guess this occurred back in October.  Where was I?  Here's the [article](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/sync-your-inbox-across-devices-with.html).  Yahoo is a joke to me.  When are they going to stop charging for everything.  Don't you know americans want everything for free!
