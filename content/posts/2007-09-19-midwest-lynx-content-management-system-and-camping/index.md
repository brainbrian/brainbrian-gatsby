I'm looking forward to wrapping up the new "2.0" version of the content management system I've been working on with Marky at Midwest Love. It should be a good release of it. I think our clients are going to really enjoy it.

On top of finishing that, I'm going camping this weekend with all my friends from The Autumn View. I'm excited. I hope I get to see some of the leaves turning colors already, but who knows.
