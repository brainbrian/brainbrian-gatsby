I'm not really sure what new incite it will bring to me in the field of object-oriented programming or actionscript 3.0, but the Adobe AS3 tour is coming to Chicago. [adobeas3tour.com](http://www.adobeas3tour.com/ 'Adobe AS3 Tour'). I'm excited to see what "the man" himself has to offer in a classroom/lecture setting. I'm still upset I missed MAX!
