We set out from Paradise on Mt. Rainier for a tour up to Cowlitz Rocks. It was a very hot, sunny spring day. The tour was long but not very technical. We had to take very little switchbacks. The GPS tracking stopped at a couple points (where you can see the straight lines). If I were looking to do a tour with great lines for turns, I would not recommend this tour. If you are however looking for a tour to see some amazing views and get some decent turns on the way out with little consequence, this is a great tour. Going back I'd very likely choose a different route to get some steeper terrain.
