[Flipboard](http://ax.itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8) for the iPhone came out this week. It's the first time on my phone I'll actually keep up with all these feeds, in particular Google Reader. I never found an app previously that allowed me to browse Google Reader in a visual way I actually liked. Now I need to buy an iPad because I hear [Flipboard](http://ax.itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8) amazing on it.

The app is FREE!
