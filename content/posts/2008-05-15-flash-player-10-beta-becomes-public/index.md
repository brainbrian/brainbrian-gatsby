Incase you haven't heard the new yet today, Flash Player 10 has become public.  Looks like some exciting new stuff.  Check it out on [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/).  It's not as significant as Flash Player 9, but it sounds pretty sweet still.  With native 3D support, will this be the death of Director?
