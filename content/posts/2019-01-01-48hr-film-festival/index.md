I spent this past weekend with a crew of 55 volunteers making a short film, 7 minutes in duration, for the [Seattle 48 Hour Film Festival](http://www.48hourfilm.com/seattle-wa). This film was created under the direction of the talented Ben Strickland of [Tricky Whiskey Films](https://www.facebook.com/TrickyWhiskeyFilmsSeattle/). It was my first time doing the 48 Hour Film Fest. It was a great experience seeing what a large group of volunteers, industry pros and amateurs, can come together and make in 2 LONG days.

We shot at a private airfield in Monroe, WA.

We got our shot of a plane riding into the sunset and a van following shortly behind with gunfire.

We had great talent thanks to all the individuals who helped plan the film.
