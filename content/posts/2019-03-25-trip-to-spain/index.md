A year before all this Covid craziness I took a trip (March 15th - 25th, 2019) to the Andalusia region with Amanda and two of our friends. The trip was very memorable, in particular the amazing architecture and street art. There is so much history, art, amazing food and wine. I hope to go back again one day as we still so much to see!
