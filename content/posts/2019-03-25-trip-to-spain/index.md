A year before all this Covid craziness I took a trip (March 15th - 25th, 2019) to the [Andalusia region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia) with Amanda and two of our friends. The trip was very memorable, in particular the amazing architecture and street art. There is so much history, art, amazing food and wine. I hope to go back again one day as we still so much to see!

In Seville we visited the Moorish castle, [Alc√°zar of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_of_Seville). We made a trip to [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar)(not Spain) on an open day due to no surf in southern Spain. There we took a trip up the [Rock of Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_of_Gibraltar) and did the [hike down](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+of+Gibraltar/@36.1565406,-5.3269935,610a,35y,218.63h,78.71t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xd0cbf7ddd3b0ff7:0x10c2257a5c95e67!8m2!3d36.1440934!4d-5.3417241). The Spanish vineyard we visted in Ronda is [Friedrich Schatz](https://www.wineronda.com/schatz). In Granada we visited the [Alhambra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra).
