Mario Strikers Charged with 3 other friends in the same room is amazing! I've been looking into [Drupal](http://drupal.org/ "Drupal"): I'm not sold.It has some great features, but still it doesn't compare to starting from scratch. I know there's a lot of technology now that "makes our lives easier", but I believe most just add clutter. Open Source is the way to go for a lot of stuff, but I still like getting down to the very core of everything and building from the ground up. I'm interested in what will come of [Wombat CMS](http://wombatcms.com/ "Wombat CMS").I started on the inital designs of an Admin 2.0 version. [Midwest Lynx](http://midwestlynx.com)! One day it will have a cute little logo. NetNewt was taken!
