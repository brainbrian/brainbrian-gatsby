Yesterday Lea and I ran almost 7 miles.  We ran from our apartment to Bradford beach.  We also saw some of the cutest dogs on the beach.  It made the fact that our apartment doesn't allow dogs worse!  In conclusion, drink lots of fluids and get new shoes.  My knee is very sore today.  Snowboard instructing really does one over on you!
