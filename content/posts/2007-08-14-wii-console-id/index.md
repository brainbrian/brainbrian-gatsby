For any of you who have Wii, I'm a recent newcomer to the system as of 1 week ago. My girlfriend and I have enjoyed Mario Party 8 and some of the Virtual Console games on the system (Super Mario Bros) for about the past week. I wonder if I should have went with the PS3, but the Wii is a whole different experience.

Here's my ID: 6330 4523 0341 2786
