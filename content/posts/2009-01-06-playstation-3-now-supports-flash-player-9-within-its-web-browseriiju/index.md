I just discovered today that PlayStation 3 is now supporting Flash Player 9.  It'd be awesome to see other systems adopt this standard like the Wii.  It also be awesome if the XBOX had a web browser.  Who knows what will happen.  Either way, I'm finding to be content in the realm of video games, I need all of the systems.  I'm still working on getting a PS3.  I know I should be learning more or maybe writing blog entries, but as of late, I've been enthralled in the fantasy worlds the different games bring me.  The iPhone has been rumored for quite some time to be adopting flash player.  It has yet to happen.  I think a big issue on all these devices may be processing power??  Any thoughts?
