I recently purchased a new action sports camera called the [Drift Innovation HD170](http://www.driftinnovation.com/hd170-action-camera). Here are the results from a day of snowboarding at Stevens Pass with some friends. This was our first day up at Stevens of the season. It was also the second day the backside of the mountain was open.
