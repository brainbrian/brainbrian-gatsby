After seeing the ProCable headphones for the iPhone on TUAW.com, I decided to buy a pair for the low price of $24.95.  I wasn't expecting much, but I was hoping for the best.  I also used the promo code to purchase them, which brought them down in price even more (RTPROMO1).

I received the headphone today.  The sound quality is what I expected, it sucks.  It's worse than the headphones that come with the iPhone.  I don't have a lot of experience with other headsets, but I was hoping to get a pair for less than $100 bucks that has the sound control and mic features of the apple headset.  The headphones do look amazing and the sound control and mic features work great, but the sound quality definitely reflects the price.  I guess they'll be an ok backup to carry around in the car.
