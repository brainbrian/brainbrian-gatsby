The first Penumbra Beer Bash was amazing. Everything went smooth. The beer flowed like a river of deliciousness and the bands were entertaining to say the least. I produced a video from the event. I hope you enjoy.

> We get sleepy in the winter. It is dark and cold and wet. We see less shows, see less of our friends, and conserve energy to use in those far-distant five days of summer. To hell with all that! Let's get drunk on good beer, dance to awesome music and celebrate the LAST WEEKEND of Winter in Seattle at a crazy underground events space strategically located right behind Mt. Baker Light rail.
