There's a new show on YouTube called American Hipster Presents. I stumbled upon the Linda Derschang episode last night. They're well produced videos about a community I love so much. I hope you enjoy as much as I did.

### Linda Derschang - American Hipster Presents #35 (Seattle - Social Life)

If you're from Seattle I'm sure a lot of you know of Linda's in Capitol Hill. Take a peek into Seattle's night life with Linda Derschang, owner of Linda's and others.

I absolutely love this art and can't wait for their show in spring of 2013.

### Rachel's Ginger Beer - American Hipster Presents #31 (Seattle - Food)

Their ginger beer is great and if you live in Capitol Hill I'm sure some of you know of Montana. Great people.
