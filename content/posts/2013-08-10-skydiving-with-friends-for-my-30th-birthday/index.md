I decided what better way to go into my 30s than jumping out of a plane. After discovering Amanda and some daredevil friends wanted to join, we possied up for some debauchery at [Skydive Snohomish](https://www.skydivesnohomish.com). Our jump on my actual day of birth was canceled due to rain/overcast, but we got to go the following week. It was a great experience, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested. I hope you enjoy the video.
