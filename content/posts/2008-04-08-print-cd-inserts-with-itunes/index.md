So  I know there may be some iTunes hatters out there, but I just discovered a useful thing with iTunes. I've used iTunes for many years now, but never noticed this feature. Maybe this is a new feature? You can actually print out different templates for jewel cases based on album artwork and track listings.  iTunes automatically formats it for you.  When you have an album selected go to the file>>print... and you'll find some nice templates.

BTW... I use eMusic for downloads. :-) thank you Marky for eMusic.
