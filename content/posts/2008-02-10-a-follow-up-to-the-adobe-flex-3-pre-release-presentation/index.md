The flex tour came to Milwaukee yesterday. It was a pretty amazing demonstration about all the great new features in being released in Adobe Flex 3. I was pretty amazed with all the new features Kevin Hoyt presented at the meeting.

I give a big thank you to [C2](http://www.c2gps.com/) for helping with the event cordination. They always do a great job and also have a great location themselves for hosting regular [monthly meetings](http://milwaukeeaug.com/). If you're reading this and currently do not attend a local user group, I highly reccommed it. Being part of user groups has allowed me to recconnect with collgues and meet new ones.

The flex presentation went quite well. Its nice to walk away with a free tshirt and cookies in hand!
