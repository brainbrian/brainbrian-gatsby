You ask? Well not a whole lot. I've been working on some banner campaigns for Mr. Bean's Holiday with my friend Taylor at Robots Made It. The banners are going well, and we will continue to complete them throughout the week. I'm not sure what my thoughts are in reguards to the movie, but I guess we'll see.

As far as the Newsboys go, Mark at Midwest Love is going to be doing their greatest hits work. I thought this was pretty exciting. The Newsboys are the most popular Christian Pop band of the past 2 decades. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsboys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsboys "newsboys")

It's pretty amazing how things are working out. Also Marky and I are beginning work on the new Hush Sound website. I'm stoked. First off, I have to complete our Admin 2.0 for all our band websites. I think we're naming it Midwest Lynx. What do you think? We really liked NetNewt, but that was already taken! I hate how people go around buying up domains. Pisses me off.
