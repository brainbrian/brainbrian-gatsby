Thanks to Coconut Skim Lattes and the early mornings spent at Alterra Foundry, I've been able to actually start reading the genius of Moock's new book. I hope to be able to finish it this year. Amongst all of my work at Marx, the freelance, and life in general, I will do my best. I read slow as molasses! I re-read as well! That's what I need to do to make it stick. I already have a good understanding of a lot of as3 concepts because of the as3 Cookbook, but I need to get back to the roots!
