So back in June my wife accepted a job in Culver City. So, 3 months later I can say we are finally settled. I even accepted a new position last week at [VideoAmp](https://videoamp.com). A lot has changed in the last couple months. I'm excited to see what the next year holds for us.

Since the move I've been surfing a lot; go figure. On the weekends we typically head south down to San-O or north to Malibu.

On weekends when we don't want to travel far we've been going to Ocean Park or the Breakwater in Venice. A couple weeks back we had an encounter with dolphins. They swam right up to/under us. It was a pretty unique experience for me. I've seen dolphins surfing before, but nothing this close.

Back to the subject of Malibu. It sure is a special place that lives up to it's name. Sure, it's one of the most crowded spots I've surfed, but for good reason. The people and waves are world-class.

I sure do feel blessed right now.
