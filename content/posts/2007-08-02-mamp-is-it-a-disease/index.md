I just started using MAMP (Macintosh, Apache, Mysql and PHP) today at work.. amazing. Simple to install and easy to use. I strongly suggest anyone who codes with PHP and MySQL to use this program. I haven't ever wanted to turn my computer into a web server by installing PHP and MySQL with the fear of updating configuration files and what not. I know I'm not as knowledgeable in the installation of this stuff as I should be. What I do know is this program is great and easy to install!
