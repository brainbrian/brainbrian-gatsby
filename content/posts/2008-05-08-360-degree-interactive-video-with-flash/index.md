Straight from the creators of google maps "street view", there's is now interactive video that you can scroll and navigate around in while the video plays. I think it shows how impressive flash player really is. Flash is pulling in an [FLV file](http://imc.cachefly.net/FijiCoralReef/Fiji_original-Fiji_original-im360_1300vid_128aud_15fps.flv 'FLV File') with the 360 degree picture. I believe they built their own 3D rendering engine to allow flash to warp/scale/distort the video properly.

Pretty cool stuff. It brings me back to my days at WIN Media when I used to have to stitch and publish IPIX files. I think they're out of business now.
