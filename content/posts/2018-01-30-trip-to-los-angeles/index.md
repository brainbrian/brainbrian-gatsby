Amanda was asked to come to Los Angeles for work the week of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Knowing we would both have of that Monday, we decided to take some extra days and fill our free time with friends and surfing. The footage was taken at Venice Beach, Ocean Park in Santa Monica, San Onofre in San Clemente, Surfrider Beach in Malibu, the Santa Monica Pier and more. It was filmed January 13th - 20th, 2018.

The West Coast was hit with a nice swell around Tuesday that week. There was a coastal watch for a large swell hitting the hardest near San Diego. It amounted for friendly waves at San-O and Malibu. I'm very grateful for receiving the clean swell and meeting some friendly people in the lineups.
