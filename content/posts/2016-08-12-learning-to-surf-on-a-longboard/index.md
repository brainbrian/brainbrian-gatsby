I picked up surfing about 4 years ago. When I first started I was on a "fun board", a 7'4" [Ocean Pulse](http://www.oceanpulsesurf.com). I quickly went from that surfing [Lib Tech](http://www.lib-tech.com/surfboards/) shortboards about 6'4" or less while working at [Mervin Manufacturing](http://www.mervin.com). Surfing wasn't really an option for me growing up in the Milwaukee, WI area. At the time I didn't find paddling out with icicles on my face appealing.

This summer I got a longboard from [Murdey Surfboards](http://www.murdeysurfboards.com). Dan Murdey was awesome to work with on the board and gave all the right recommendations. Dan glassed for [Gerry Lopez](http://www.gerrylopezsurfboards.com) for about 15 years and now does all his own shaping, tinting and glassing. I've been riding my [Bells & Whistles](http://www.murdeysurfboards.com/viper-3-2) nose rider for most of the summer and it's been a blast. I'm just now starting to try to learn to cross step. Check out the video below from last weekend in Westport, WA.
