I love that he commented on working on snowboarding and gardening. Even the most brilliant of minds still have time to play!

You can view the video [on AIR... Bus Tour](http://onair.adobe.com/blogs/videos/2007/05/14/colin-moock-interview-on-essential-actionscript-3/ 'Colin Moock').

I have the as3 Cookbook, but it's time to go out and buy this one. I got an offer through O'Reilly to upgrade for cheap anyway because I have the as2 book. Who-hoo!

I did my first as3 project about 1 month ago for a client at Marx Creative.. UW Credit Union. It was a definite learning experience that I have grown from. I still have a long way to go though.

There's not a day that goes by that I question my skills. Does one ever get past that?

This video has been out for a while, no new news; I just stumbled upon it today.
