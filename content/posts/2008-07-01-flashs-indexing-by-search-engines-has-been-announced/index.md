Take a look at the articles:

[adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swf_searchability.html 'Adobe Flash Indexing by Search Engines')

[google.com](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-learns-to-crawl-flash.html 'Google can crawl flash')

This sounds pretty exciting to me.
