I headed on my bike over to the [Marginal Way Skatepark](https://www.facebook.com/mwdiy/) event, [Lords of Seatown](https://www.facebook.com/events/450360218696289/). After a short ride over the West Seattle bridge I arrived at the event late afternoon just in time for the Men's finals. The competition was stiff. [Zion O'Friel](https://www.instagram.com/zionofriel/) was putting down some heavy lines in competition with [Phil Hansen](https://www.instagram.com/nutrash_hansen/)Â and the rest of the men in the finals.

There were fun side sessions going on throughout the day. In particular there was some serious skating going down in the "newer" pool area. Kyle Ward and Zion were especially fun to watch grind down some pool coping. In the end the event raised $4,208 for the park and brought the 5 year fund-raising total to just over $20,000. Pretty awesome.

On my bike ride home I took the drone up for a shot of the Port of Seattle.
