Our friend Brendan was in from Philly. We had a great day on the mountain. Chris, Rob and myself took an avalanche awareness class at Stevens Pass the day before. The class was great and definitely makes me feel a lot more comfortable hiking into the backcountry. Chris and I have been trying our hand at snow shoeing and also got our beacon/probe/shovel set. I can't wait for Jackson Hole.

The track in the video is "Edge of Extremes" by Clubfeet.
