I have made several recent entries about code development for the web. I recently stumbled upon a new studio for programming on the web. It's called "[Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/)". I have yet to use it extensively, but I'm looking forward to using the tool. It seems like there are more plug-in features than eclipse and it seems to be based of the eclipse IDE.

> _Aptana Studio Community Edition is the free, open source Ajax and PHP development environment with over a million downloads that makes developing web pages fun again. This edition comes with optional packages to support Adobe AIR, iPhone, and Ruby on Rails development to integrate Ajax applications with emerging technologies._

If anyone is currently using it, be sure to let me know what you think of it.
