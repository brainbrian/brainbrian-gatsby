More and more phones are coming out every week. It seems the cellphone industry has really been doing it's best to make the next "it" phone. With non cellphone related companies now entering the market I think things could really get exciting. Who knows what's next, but for now we always have google. [Google meets the iPhone](http://www.techfresh.net/archives/2007/08/09/googles-linux-based-phone-to-launch-in-2008/ 'Google Cell Phone').   Hopefully it's really like the iPhone on crack, because as of now, I'm not impressed with the iPhone at all.  The phone I've been most interested in is the Helio Ocean.  My contract with sprint is up in October, but until then, my Treo 650 will do.
