This year I decided to make an Amazon wish list to aid the people in my life who would be getting me gifts. It paid off big time. Everything I got I loved. The [Amazon Wish List Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ciagpekplgpbepdgggflgmahnjgiaced 'Amazon Wish List Chrome Plugin') is a nice helper when bookmarking stuff you want on your list. I made out big time. Some gifts I love are the [Akai MPK49](http://www.akaipro.com/mpk49), [James Jean "Rebus"](http://www.jamesjean.com/bound/2011/Rebus/1) book & [James Jean "RIFT"](http://www.jamesjean.com/bound/2010/RIFT/1) accordion book.
