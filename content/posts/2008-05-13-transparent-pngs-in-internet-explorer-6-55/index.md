I have known that there's a javascript/css fix for transparent PNGs in Internet Explorer, but I've tried to stay away from this always!  As of today, I was faced with answering this problem on a site I'm working on.  I found it's quite simple and there's a great article on this topic at "[24 Ways to Impress Your Friends](http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6)".  Have at errrrrrrrrr.
